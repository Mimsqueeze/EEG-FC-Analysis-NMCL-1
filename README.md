# NMCL-Project-1

This repository contains the implementation for a comparative analysis of two different methods of functional connectivity. Functional connectivity is a
quantitative measure of how different regions of the brain interact with each other, which is to classify between two levels of mental workload. Specifically, we are evaluating the performance of two FC methods, namely phase lag index (PLI) and coherence, in mental workload classification of EEG data. Such EEG data is shown below.

## Installation and Usage
To run the programs in the repository is simple. Simply clone the repository into your local directory and you can run the python files located in the repository. Here's a list of the files you can run and what they do:
| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `classification.py` | Performs classification of high or low mental workload on EEG features extracted from feature_extraction.py |
|`feature_extraction.py` | Reads in EEG data and extracts features to be used in classification |
| `plot cleaned data.py` | Plots cleaned EEG data |
| `plot raw data.py` | Plots raw EEG data |
| `plot results` | Plots the performance of different classifiers in classifying high/low mental workload of EEG data |
